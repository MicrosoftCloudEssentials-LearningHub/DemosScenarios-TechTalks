## Platform Enhancements

> Setting Up OneLake Security:

1. **Define Security Roles**: Create roles within OneLake to manage access to data tables or folders. These roles can include Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer, each with different levels of access.
2. **Assign Permissions**: Assign permissions at the workspace level to control access to all items within that workspace. Use the sharing feature to grant users direct access to specific items if they do not need access to the entire workspace
3. **Configure Item Permissions**: Use the Manage Permissions page to add or remove individual item permissions for users or groups. This allows for fine-grained control over who can access specific data items.
4. **Set Up Compute Permissions**:  Grant data access through the SQL compute engine by restricting access to specific tables and schemas. Implement row and column-level security to further refine access controls.
5. **Implement User Identity Mode**: Enable user identity mode for SQL Analytics Endpoints to ensure that security policies are enforced based on user roles and permissions

> Best Practices:

1. **Least Privilege Access**: Assign permissions at the appropriate level to ensure that users only have access to the data necessary for their tasks. Avoid over-provisioning to reduce security risks.
2. **Secure by Workload**: Grant users access to specific data workloads through item permissions, compute permissions, and OneLake data access roles. Configure access to the least privileged level required for the user's job.
3. **Use Data Access Roles**: Use OneLake data access roles to control access to folders and tables within a lakehouse. This allows for selective access to specific items in a lakehouse.
4. **Monitor and Audit Access**: Regularly review and audit access permissions to ensure compliance with security policies. Adjust permissions as needed to maintain a secure environment.

### OneLake Security (Private Preview)

> Here are the key aspects:

- **Granular Security Definitions**: OneLake Security enables defining `row and column-level` security directly within OneLake, ensuring consistent security rules across different Fabric engines.
- **Unified Security Management**: With OneLake Security, `roles can be created to grant access to specific data tables or folders`. These roles can further restrict access using row or column-level security.
- **Automatic Enforcement**: `Security roles` defined in OneLake `are automatically enforced when querying through Spark notebooks, SQL Analytics Endpoints, and Power BI in Direct Lake mode`.
- **User Identity Mode**: SQL Analytics Endpoints now support a `user identity` mode, ensuring that OneLake Security is the source of truth for all access through SQL endpoints. This `mode means` that `SQL Analytics Endpoints` can now operate based on individual user identities. This means that access and permissions `are managed at the user level rather than at a broader level (like application or service level)`.
- **Early Access**:  Customers can [sign up for early access](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_BIbobSVbtGoFFUDM3gfGJUNlBWWVpMNDU5NzY5U1NBQVFHOUJPNE5CNS4u) to provide feedback and experience these capabilities before the broad public preview

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

> The Microsoft Fabric Command Line Interface (CLI), also known as `fabric-cli` or `fab`, provides a powerful tool for executing commands across the Fabric platform using terminal prompts or pre-written scripts. Key features include:

- **Installation and Authentication**: The CLI can be installed using `pip` and supports different `authentication methods, including interactive, service principal, and managed identity authentication`.
- **Command Execution**: Users can execute a wide range of commands to manage Fabric resources, deploy applications, and automate workflows.
- **Interactive Mode**: The CLI supports an interactive mode, allowing users to execute commands in a more user-friendly environment.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Fabric CLI can be integrated with `Azure DevOps pipelines and GitHub Actions for automated deployments and robust CI/CD pipelines`.

### Variable Library

> Allows users to define and manage variables at the workspace level. This feature enhances efficiency and consistency across various workspace items.

- **Workspace-Level Management**: `Variables can be defined and managed at the workspace level`, making them accessible `across different workspace items such as data pipelines, notebooks, and lakehouse shortcuts`.
- **Enhanced Data Pipelines**: The Variable Library is `already available for use in data pipelines, allowing for more streamlined and efficient data processing`.
- **Future Integrations**: Plans are in place to `expand the use of the Variable Library to other areas within the Fabric platform, further enhancing its utility`.
