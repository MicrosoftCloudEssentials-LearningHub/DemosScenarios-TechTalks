> [!NOTE]
> This example is around how to grant access to a subscription using a custom role.


> Custom roles in Azure are a powerful feature of Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) that allow you to create roles tailored to the specific needs of your organization

> E.g., Imagine you have a team of developers who need to manage virtual machines but should not have access to billing information. You can create a custom role that includes permissions to start, stop, and restart virtual machines but excludes any billing-related actions.

## Overview 

> Custom roles are user-defined roles that provide fine-grained access management to Azure resources. Unlike built-in roles, which come predefined with a set of permissions, custom roles allow you to specify exactly what actions can be performed and on which resources. <br/>


| **Component**       | **Description**                                                                                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**            | A unique name for the custom role.                                                                    |
| **Description**     | A brief description of what the role does.                                                            |
| **Actions**         | The specific operations that the role allows. For example, `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/start/action` allows starting virtual machines. |
| **NotActions**      | Operations that are explicitly denied, even if they fall under a broader action.                      |
| **DataActions**     | Operations on data within a resource, such as reading or writing to a storage account.                |
| **NotDataActions**  | Data operations that are explicitly denied.                                                           |
| **AssignableScopes**| The scopes (e.g., subscriptions, resource groups) where the role can be assigned.                     |

Custom roles are used to:
- `Tailor Permissions`: Provide only the necessary permissions to users, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- `Enhance Security`: By limiting permissions to the minimum required, you enhance the security of your Azure environment.
- `Improve Compliance`: Ensure that users have permissions that align with organizational policies and compliance requirements.

  
## How to Setup

Custom roles can be created using various methods:

| **Method**         | **Description**                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Portal**   | A user-friendly interface to define and manage custom roles.                                          |
| **Azure CLI**      | Command-line interface for scripting and automation.                                                  |
| **Azure PowerShell**| Another scripting tool for creating and managing roles.                                               |
| **REST API**       | For programmatic access and integration with other systems.                                           |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure you log in to the admin account, as you need admin permissions to set up the custom role.

1. Sign in to Azure CLI: `az login`

- Click on `Enter`, the `highlighted` configuration is the one assigned to the account.

2. Create a file. E.g., named `custom_role.json` with the required structure. Below is an example of a custom role for subscription access. Click [here to see the example file](./src/custom_role.json)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This custom role example provides extensive permissions for managing resources and deployments within the subscription, including full access to all actions and specific permissions for role assignments and resource deployments. However, it explicitly denies permissions for critical authorization, policy, and administrative actions to ensure security and compliance, preventing unauthorized changes to key configurations and settings.

 ```json
    {
      "Name": "{YOUR_CUSTOM_ROLE}",
      "Description": "",
      "AssignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}"
      ],
      "Actions": [

          "Microsoft.Authorization/roleManagementPolicies/write"
      ],
      "DataActions": []
  }

 ```

3. Create the custom role: Use the following command to create the role using the JSON file.

    ```powershell
     az role definition create --role-definition {file-name}.json
    ```
    
    In this example:
    
    ```powershell
    az role definition create --role-definition custom_role.json
    ```

4. Verify the custom role: List your custom roles to ensure it was created successfully.

    ```powershell
    az role definition list --custom-role-only true
    ```

    <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5449b403-4d1b-4bdb-9ff9-c1bfd406c6d0">

5. Validate the creation of your role. Depending on the assigned actions, you will see the role under either the pricegeled tab or the job function tab. Click on `view` to see detailed information about the actions included in the role.

6. Assign the custom role to the necessary users. Navigate to `Access control (IAM)`, click on `+ Add`, and select `Add role assignment`:

  - Search for the role name in either the `Job Function Roles` or `Privileged Administrator Roles` tabs. Select the role, click on `+ Select members`, add the required members, and finally click on `Review + assign`:

7. Once you assign the role, the new member will receive an email similar to this:

8. If the subscription is not visible, select `Advanced options`, then `View eligible subscriptions`, and finally, click `Activate` the role. You should now be able to see the subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This custom role is for a period of 8 hours, so every 8 hours the role will end as it is time-bound. You can choose to change it to a permanent role so the user does not need to activate the role every 8 hours. To do that, please use the admin account to go to the subscription, under `Access control (IAM)`, click on `Role assignments`. Search for the assigned role, click on `Eligible time-bound`, and change it to `Permanent`.
