## Examples of use cases

<img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdbc5769-ea4a-402f-89fb-7a812e14e501">

## Collect metadata information from Apache Airflow

> This capability is currently in public preview and is achieved through integration with **OpenLineage**, an open framework for data lineage collection and analysis.

How it works:
1. **Enable OpenLineage in Airflow**: By enabling OpenLineage in your Airflow instance, metadata and lineage information about jobs and datasets are automatically tracked as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) execute.
2. **Azure Event Hubs**: The tracked metadata and lineage information are sent to an Azure Event Hubs instance that you configure.
3. **Microsoft Purview**: Purview subscribes to the events from Azure Event Hubs, parses them, and ingests the metadata and lineage into the data map.

This integration supports capturing metadata such as:
- Airflow workspace
- Airflow DAG
- Airflow task
