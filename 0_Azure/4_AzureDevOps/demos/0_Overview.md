## Azure Boards

> Supports Agile project management and tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **Kanban Boards**: Visualize work items and their flow through various stages. Teams can customize columns to reflect their workflow and easily move tasks across the board.
  - **Scrum Boards**: Manage sprints and backlogs, track progress, and plan iterations. Scrum boards help teams organize work into manageable chunks and deliver incremental value.
  - **Work Item Tracking**: Create and manage work items such as user stories, tasks, bugs, and features. Work items can be linked to code changes, builds, and releases.
  - **Backlogs**: Prioritize and manage the product backlog. Teams can break down features into user stories and tasks, estimate effort, and plan sprints.
  - **Sprints**: Plan and manage sprint cycles, track sprint progress, and review completed work. Teams can use sprint planning tools to allocate work and monitor velocity.
  - **Customizable Workflows**: Tailor workflows to match team processes. Customize states, transitions, and rules for work items to ensure they align with team practices.

## Azure Repos

> Provides version control for code repositories.

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **Git Repositories**: Host and manage Git repositories. Teams can clone, commit, push, and pull code changes, and collaborate using branches and pull requests.
  - **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)**: An alternative to Git, TFVC is a centralized version control system. It allows teams to manage code with check-ins and branching.
  - **Pull Requests**: Facilitate code reviews and collaboration. Developers can create pull requests to propose code changes, review code, discuss modifications, and merge changes.
  - **Branch Policies**: Enforce best practices and quality standards. Teams can set policies for branch protection, requiring code reviews, and ensuring builds pass before merging.
  - **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to standards. Reviewers can comment on code, suggest changes, and approve or reject pull requests.
</details>

## Azure Pipelines

> Facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **Build Automation**: Automate the building of code. Pipelines can compile code, run tests, and produce artifacts for deployment.
  - **Release Pipelines**: Automate the deployment process. Teams can define release pipelines to deploy applications to various environments, such as development, staging, and production.
  - **Deployment to Various Environments**: Deploy applications to multiple environments, including on-premises servers, cloud services, and containers. Pipelines support deployment to Azure, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and more.
  - **Integration with Multiple Tools and Services**: Integrate with a wide range of tools and services, such as GitHub, Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform. Pipelines can trigger builds and deployments based on code changes and other events.
  - **Support for Various Programming Languages and Platforms**: Build and deploy applications written in different languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP. Pipelines support Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

</details>

## Azure Test Plans

> Manages testing processes and ensures software quality.

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **Manual Testing**: Create and execute manual test cases. Testers can document test steps, expected results, and actual outcomes.
  - **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines. Teams can run automated tests as part of the build and release process to ensure code quality.
  - **Test Case Management**: Organize and manage test cases, test suites, and test plans. Teams can track test coverage, prioritize tests, and manage test execution.
  - **Test Execution**: Execute tests and record results. Testers can run tests manually or automatically, capture test results, and log defects.
  - **Reporting**: Generate reports and dashboards to track test progress, test results, and quality metrics. Teams can use these insights to make informed decisions and improve software quality.

</details>

## Azure Artifacts

> Manages and shares packages within the development team.

<details>
  <summary>Features</summary>

  - **Package Feeds**: Create and manage package feeds for different package types, including Maven, npm, NuGet, and Python. Teams can publish, consume, and share packages.
  - **Versioning**: Manage package versions to ensure compatibility and stability. Teams can use versioning to track changes and maintain different versions of packages.
  - **Dependency Management**: Manage dependencies between packages. Teams can define dependencies, resolve conflicts, and ensure that applications use the correct versions of packages.
  - **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**: Integrate package management with CI/CD pipelines. Teams can automate the publishing and consumption of packages as part of the build and release process.
