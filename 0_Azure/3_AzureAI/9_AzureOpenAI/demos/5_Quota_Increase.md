> [!TIP]
> Requesting a quota increase for the current standard deployment in a `specific region is a straightforward first step`. Please [fill this form](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR4xPXO648sJKt4GoXAed-0pUMFE1Rk9CU084RjA0TUlVSUlMWEQzVkJDNCQlQCN0PWcu), is used to submit requests for `quota increases for the standard deployment type`. Requests are accepted and processed in the order they are received. Priority is given to customers whose traffic usage reaches their existing quota allocation. If this condition is not met, your request may be denied.  If this does not `meet your needs, please review the` [process outlined below](#additional-approaches) `and choose the option that best fits your use case.`

## How to 

> `Requesting a quota increase` for the current `type of deployment` in `specific region` is a straightforward approach 

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**:
   - Open your web browser and go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Enter your Azure account credentials to log in.
2. **Navigate to Quotas**: In the search bar at the top of the Azure Portal, type `Quotas`.
3. **Select the Resource**:
   - In the Quotas page, you will see a list of resources.
   - Find and click on the specific resource for which you want to increase the quota (e.g., Azure OpenAI).
4. **Request Quota Increase**:
   - Once you are on the resource page, look for an option that says `Request quota increase` or similar.
   - Click on this option to proceed.
5. **Enter New Limit**:
   - A form will appear where you can specify the new quota limit you need.
   - Enter the desired limit and provide any necessary details or justification for the increase.
6. **Submit the Request**: After filling out the form, click on the `Submit` button to send your request to Microsoft.
7. **Wait for Approval**:
   - Microsoft will review your request. This process may take some time.
   - You will receive a notification once your request has been approved or if additional information is needed.
8. **Check Status**: You can check the status of your quota increase request in the Azure Portal under the `Notifications` or `Support requests` section.

## Additional approaches 

| **Approach** | **Explanation** | **Use Cases** |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Redeploying the AI model using Global Standard** | Redeploying from Standard to Global Standard can provide higher TPM (Transactions Per Minute), which improves performance. It does incur downtime, so testing in a Dev or non-prod environment first is a good precaution. | Useful when higher TPM is needed to meet performance requirements. | 
| **Considering a different model** | TPMs vary by model. For example, using `gpt 4o mini` on Global Standard deployment provides 2000K TPM, whereas `gpt4o` in the same type of deployment offers 450K TPM. Another example is using `gpt-4 turbo` on Global Standard deployment, which provides 3000K TPM, whereas `gpt-4 base` offers 500K TPM. | When the current model does not meet performance requirements or when higher TPM is needed. | 
| **PTU reservations** | Allows for more predictable performance and cost management. | Useful for managing performance and costs in environments with variable workloads. |
| **Deploying another Standard in a different region** | Using a load balancer across the two regions is a good strategy to distribute the load and ensure redundancy. | Ensures high availability and disaster recovery by distributing the load across multiple regions. | 

### Redeploying the AI model using Global Standard

1. **Assess Current Deployment**: Review the architecture and components to understand the current setup.
2. **Plan Downtime**: Communicate with stakeholders and schedule the redeployment during off-peak hours to minimize impact.
3. **Set Up Dev Environment**: Create a development or non-production environment that mirrors the production environment to safely test changes.
4. **Test Redeployment**: Apply the redeployment steps in the dev environment to identify and resolve potential issues before production deployment.
5. **Backup Data**: Ensure all data is backed up to prevent data loss during the redeployment process.
6.  **Stop Current Deployment**: Safely stop the current deployment to apply updates or changes.
7.  **Apply Updates**: Implement the necessary updates or changes to the deployment.
8.  **Restart Deployment**: Restart the deployment and ensure all services are running correctly.
9.  **Monitor Post-Deployment**: Check logs, monitor performance metrics, and verify that all functionalities are working as expected. 

### Considering a different model

1. **Evaluate Current Model**: Analyze the performance metrics of the current model and identify any limitations or issues.
2. **Research Alternatives**: Compare different models like `gpt 4o mini`, `gpt4o`, `gpt-4 turbo`, and `gpt-4 base` to understand their capabilities and TPM (Transactions Per Minute).
3. **Select Model**: Choose a model that meets your performance requirements based on the comparison.
4. **Plan Transition**: Develop a transition plan, including configuration changes.
5. **Deploy in Test Environment**: Implement the new model in a test environment.
6. **Validate Performance**: Test and validate the new model's performance.
7. **Deploy in Production**: Once validated, deploy the new model in production.

### PTU reservations

1. **Understand PTUs**: Research PTU (Performance and Throughput Units) and their benefits.
2. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: Review system usage patterns to determine PTU needs.
3. **Reserve PTUs**: Use the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or API to reserve PTUs.
4. **Confirm Reservations**: Ensure reservations are correctly applied.
5. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor system performance.
6. **Adjust Reservations**: Modify PTU reservations as needed to optimize costs and performance. 

### Deploying another Standard in a different region

1. **Identify Regions**: Select a secondary region for deployment.
2. **Deploy Standard**: Follow deployment steps for the secondary region.
3. **Ensure Consistency**: Make sure configurations match the primary deployment.
4. **Set Up Load Balancer**: Configure a load balancer to distribute traffic.
5. **Configure Health Checks**: Set up health checks and routing rules.
6. **Test Failover**: Simulate failover scenarios to ensure traffic distribution.
7. **Verify Continuity**: Ensure the system maintains service continuity during failover.
8. **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly check performance and health of both deployments and the load balancer.
