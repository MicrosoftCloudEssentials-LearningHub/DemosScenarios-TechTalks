> Explanation:

- **PTUs**: Provisioned Throughput Units represent the capacity of tokens that can be processed per minute.
- **Calls per Minute**: The number of API calls that can be made per minute.
- **Tokens in Prompt**: The number of tokens in the input prompt for each call.
- **Tokens in Response**: The number of tokens in the model's response for each call.
- **Tokens per Minute (TPM)**: The total number of tokens processed per minute, calculated as:

$$
\text{TPM} = \text{Calls per Minute} \times (\text{Tokens in Prompt} + \text{Tokens in Response})
$$

> Example Calculation:
For 50 PTUs:

1. **Calls per Minute**: Calculate the number of calls per minute:

$$
\text{Calls per Minute} = \text{PTUs} \times \text{Calls per PTU per Minute}
$$

$$
\text{Calls per Minute} = 50 \times 10 = 500
$$

2. **Tokens per Minute**: Calculate the total tokens per minute:

$$
\text{TPM} = \text{Calls per Minute} \times (\text{Tokens in Prompt} + \text{Tokens in Response})
$$

$$
\text{TPM} = 500 \times (50 + 100) = 500 \times 150 = 75,000
$$

This means with 50 PTUs, you can process 75,000 tokens per minute.

## Provisioned Capacity Calculator

> Improve accuracy of your estimate by adding multiple workloads to your PTU calculation. Each workload will be calculated and displayed as well as the aggregate total if both are running at the same time to your deployment.

8. **Check Status**: You can check the status of your quota increase request in the Azure Portal under the `Notifications` or `Support requests` section.

## Key considerations to ensure optimal performance, security, and cost-efficiency

| Key Consideration     | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Selection**         | - Choose a model that fits your use case. <br/> - Consider performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and throughput. |
| **Scalability**             | - Configure auto-scaling to handle varying loads. <br/> - Allocate sufficient compute resources to meet expected demand. |
| **Security**                | - Implement data encryption both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information. <br/> - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the deployed models. |
| **Cost Management**         | - Select the appropriate billing model (e.g., pay-as-you-go, per token/request) based on your usage patterns. <br/> - Regularly monitor usage and costs to avoid unexpected expenses. |
| **Integration**             | - Ensure the deployed model's API endpoints are easily accessible and well-documented for integration with other applications. <br/> - Consider how the model will fit into existing workflows and systems. |
| **Compliance**              | - Ensure your deployment complies with relevant regulations and industry standards. Maintain logs and audit trails for all interactions with the deployed models. |
| **Maintenance and Updates** | - Plan for regular updates and retraining of models to maintain accuracy and relevance. <br/> - Continuously monitor model performance and make adjustments as needed. |
| **User Experience**         | - Optimize for low latency to ensure a smooth user experience. <br/> - Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on model performance. |
