## What is a Semantic Index?

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meaning-Based Retrieval  | Unlike traditional indexing, which relies on exact keyword matches, a semantic index understands the context and relationships between words and data points. This allows it to retrieve information that is semantically related, even if the exact keywords aren't present. |
| Vectorization            | It uses vectors, which are numerical representations of data points (like words, images, or other types of data). These vectors are arranged in a multi-dimensional space where semantically similar data points are clustered together. |
| Contextual Understanding | By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, a semantic index can understand the nuanced meanings and intentions behind text, making it possible to provide more relevant search results. |
| Scalability              | Semantic indexing can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making it suitable for big data applications. |
| Real-Time Processing     | Capable of processing and indexing data in real-time, allowing for up-to-date search results and insights. |
| Application Areas        | Used in various fields such as search engines, recommendation systems, and data analysis tools to improve accuracy and relevance. |

> The SharePoint Semantic Index is a feature within Microsoft 365 that enhances data retrieval and search capabilities specifically for SharePoint content. <br/>
> - **Data Mapping**: The SharePoint Semantic Index creates a map of your SharePoint data, identifying relationships and making important connections between different pieces of information. <br/>
> - **Vectorization**: It uses vectors (numerical representations of data points) to cluster semantically similar data points together. This allows for more advanced search capabilities beyond simple keyword matching. <br/>
> - **Contextual Relevance**: By understanding the context and relationships between data points, the semantic index helps provide more relevant and personalized search results.
