## Overview 

| **Step**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retrieval**  | The system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a knowledge base or external data source based on the input query. This step ensures that the model has access to up-to-date and specific information that can enhance the response. |
| **Augmentation** | The retrieved information is then used to augment the input query. This augmented input provides additional context and details that the generative model can use to produce a more informed response.                                                   |
| **Generation** | A generative model (such as GPT-4) processes the augmented input to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response. The output is a combination of the model's language generation capabilities and the retrieved factual information.               |

> Applications of RAG Pattern:
- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers by retrieving relevant documents and generating responses based on them.
- **Document Summarization**: Summarizing documents by retrieving key sections and generating concise summaries.
- **Conversational AI**: Enhancing chatbot responses with up-to-date information from external sources.

```

1. **Set Up a Knowledge Base**: Store your documents in Azure Storage Blob Containers or another accessible data source.
2. **Configure a Retrieval System**: Use Azure AI Search to index and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries.
3. **Integrate with a Generative Model**: Use a generative model like GPT-4 to process the retrieved documents and generate responses.

> Traditional methods and the `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` pattern:

| **Aspect**                | **Traditional Methods**                                                                 | **RAG Pattern**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model Type**            | Static, pre-trained models that rely on historical data. These models do not update dynamically and can become outdated. | Dynamic integration of retrieval and generative models, allowing for real-time data updates, keeping responses current and relevant. |
| **Data Freshness**        | Relies on pre-trained data, which may not reflect the latest information.                | Retrieves the most recent data from external sources, ensuring up-to-date information.            |
| **Context Understanding** | Often lacks the ability to fully understand the context of a query, leading to less accurate results. | Enhances context understanding by incorporating real-time information retrieval, providing richer context for responses. |
| **Retrieval Techniques**  | Uses keyword matching techniques like BM25 and TF-IDF, which may not capture the semantic meaning of queries. | Employs advanced semantic search techniques that better understand the intent behind queries, leading to more relevant results. |
| **Accuracy**              | May struggle with understanding context and semantic meaning, resulting in less accurate responses. | Improves accuracy by grounding responses in verified external knowledge, reducing the likelihood of errors. |
| **Risk of Hallucinations**| Higher risk of generating incorrect information as responses are based solely on training data. | Reduces this risk by grounding responses in real-time, verified information from external sources. |
| **Flexibility**           | Limited to specific data types and formats, which can restrict their applicability.      | Capable of handling various data types, including text, images, and videos, making it more versatile. |
| **Adaptability**          | Requires extensive retraining to incorporate new information, which can be time-consuming and costly. | More adaptable as it integrates real-time data without the need for frequent retraining.           |
| **Cost Efficiency**       | Can be resource-intensive due to the need for frequent retraining and large labeled datasets. | More cost-effective as it minimizes the need for extensive retraining and leverages existing data sources. |
| **Applications**          | Suitable for basic search and static content generation.                                | Ideal for complex applications such as healthcare, customer support, and content creation, where up-to-date and contextually relevant information is crucial. |

## Semantic Ranker 

> Semantic rankers in Azure AI Search are advanced features that improve search relevance by using Microsoft's language understanding models to re-rank search results based on their semantic meaning. `This technology is particularly useful for content-rich and descriptive data, such as knowledge bases and online documentation`.

| **Step**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initial Ranking        | When a query is made, the search service first uses traditional ranking algorithms like `BM25` or `Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)` to generate an initial set of results. |
| Semantic Ranking       | The initial results are then passed to the Semantic Ranker, which uses deep learning models adapted from Microsoft Bing. These models understand the context and semantic meaning of the query to re-rank the results based on their relevance. |
| Summarization and Scoring | - **Input Collection**: The system collects and summarizes inputs from the top 50 results. It focuses on text fields like titles, keywords, and content, trimming excessively long strings to fit model constraints. <br/> - **Scoring**: The summarized inputs are scored for semantic relevance. Each document receives a score from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater relevance. |
| Output Generation      | The Semantic Ranker generates outputs that include: <br/> - **Semantic Captions**: Verbatim sentences and phrases that best summarize the content, with highlights over key passages. <br/> - **Semantic Answers**: Direct answers to queries posed as questions, extracted from the document text. |
| Efficiency and Performance | To ensure quick processing, the system consolidates and reduces inputs, allowing the reranking step to be completed within the expected query latency. |

In summary, Semantic rankers analyze the context and meaning of both the query and the documents, using deep learning models adapted from Microsoft Bing. This process involves:
- **Summarizing Inputs**: Collecting and summarizing the most relevant parts of documents.
- **Scoring Results**: Assigning relevance scores based on semantic understanding.
- **Outputting Enhanced Results**: Providing re-ranked results along with captions and answers.

| **Key Function**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Secondary Ranking**             | After an initial ranking using traditional methods like BM25, semantic rankers apply a secondary ranking to promote the most semantically relevant results. |
| **Semantic Captions and Highlights** | They extract and highlight key phrases and sentences from documents, making it easier for users to understand why a result is relevant. |
| **Semantic Answers**              | For queries that resemble questions, semantic rankers can provide direct answers extracted from the content. |

> Steps:

- Go to your `index`. It's under Search Management.
- Choose your index or create a new one.
- Under `semantic configurations`, create a new one or edit an existing one.

## Scoring profiles (fine tune)

> Scoring profiles in Azure AI Search are `configurations that determine how search results are ranked based on relevance`. They allow you to customize the ranking algorithm to better suit your specific search requirements. BM25, or `Best Matching 25`, is a `ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query`. It’s an evolution of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model and is part of the family of probabilistic information retrieval models.

> [!NOTE]
> By using scoring profiles, you can fine-tune the search experience to ensure that the most relevant and useful results are presented to users.

| **Key Component**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Text Scoring**        | Adjusts the importance of specific fields in the search index. For example, you can give more weight to matches in the "title" field than in the "description" field. |
| **Magnitude Scoring**   | Boosts results based on numeric values in the index. For instance, you can prioritize products with higher ratings. |
| **Freshness Scoring**   | Prioritizes newer content by boosting documents based on date fields.           |
| **Distance Scoring**    | Enhances results based on geographical proximity, useful for location-based searches. |

> How Scoring Profiles Work: 
- **Field Weights**: Assign different weights to fields to influence the ranking of search results.
- **Boost Functions**: Apply functions to boost scores based on field values, such as boosting newer documents or those with higher ratings.
- **Custom Scoring**: Combine multiple scoring functions to create a tailored ranking strategy that meets your specific needs.

| **Step**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition and Setup   | - **Scoring Profile Definition**: A scoring profile is defined within the index schema. It includes weighted fields and functions that determine how scores are adjusted. <br/> - **Weighted Fields**: These are specific fields in your documents that you want to give more importance to. For example, you might want matches in the `title` field to be more relevant than those in the `content` field. <br/> - **Functions**: These are used to boost scores based on numeric data, such as dates, ranges, or geographic coordinates. Functions include `distance`, `freshness`, `magnitude`, and `tag`. |
| Application            | - **Query Execution**: When a search query is executed, the scoring profile is applied to adjust the relevance scores of the search results. <br/> - **Boosting Criteria**: The profile boosts the scores of documents that meet the specified criteria. For example, a document closer to a specified location might receive a higher score if a `distance` function is used. |
| Scoring Process        | - **Initial Scoring**: The search service first uses traditional ranking algorithms like BM25 to generate an initial set of results. <br/> - **Profile Application**: The scoring profile is then applied to these results. Weighted fields and functions adjust the scores based on the defined criteria. <br/> - **Final Ranking**: The adjusted scores are used to produce the final ranked list of search results. |
| Efficiency and Performance | - **Optimization**: The system optimizes the application of scoring profiles to ensure quick processing and minimal impact on query latency. <br/> - **Iterative Testing**: Profiles are often tested iteratively to fine-tune the boosting criteria and ensure they improve search relevance effectively. |

> Steps to create a scoring profile:
- Click on `Add scoring profile`, add your `profile name` and the `fields and weights`. Those numbers are based on your criteria.

     <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e64f6ee6-f342-4493-8fe9-03daabab2ce8">

   - Example JSON configuration:

       ```json
        {
          "name": "ocr-skillset",
          "skills": [
            {
              "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Vision.OcrSkill",
              "description": "Extract text from images",
              "context": "/document",
              "inputs": [
                {
                  "name": "image",
                  "source": "/document/normalized_images/*"
                }
              ],
              "outputs": [
                {
                  "name": "text",
                  "targetName": "ocrText"
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
          "cognitiveServices": {
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Azure.Search.CognitiveServicesByKey",
            "description": "mycogsvcs",
            "key": ""
          }
        }
        ```
  - If needed, you can click `+ Add new skill` to add a new template to the skillset:

2. **Create Indexer**:
   - Configure an indexer to use the skillset and specify the data source and target index.
   - Example JSON configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "my-indexer",
       "dataSourceName": "my-data-source",
       "targetIndexName": "my-index",
       "skillsetName": "ocr-skillset",
       "schedule": {
         "interval": "PT2H"
       },
       "parameters": {
         "batchSize": 50,
         "maxFailedItems": 0,
         "maxFailedItemsPerBatch": 0
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Run Indexer**: Execute the indexer to start processing documents and applying the skills.
4. **Verify Enrichment**: Check the enriched data in the search index to ensure the skills have been applied correctly.

### OCR in Azure AI Search

> `Optical Character Recognition (OCR)` is a skill in Azure AI Search that extracts text from images. 

Here's how it works:
1. **Skill Parameters**:
   - **detectOrientation**: Detects the orientation of the image.
   - **defaultLanguageCode**: Specifies the language of the input text.
2. **Skill Inputs**: `image` The image field from which text is to be extracted.
3. **Skill Outputs**:
   - **text**: The plain text extracted from the image.
   - **layoutText**: Structured text with information about the location of the text in the image.
4. **Execution**:
   - The OCR skill uses machine learning models from Azure AI Vision to recognize printed and handwritten text in various image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF).
   - The extracted text is added to the enrichment tree and can be used for further processing or directly indexed.

## Schedulers 

> Used to automate the execution of indexers at specified intervals. This is particularly useful when your source data changes over time or when dealing with large datasets that need to be indexed regularly.

| **Aspect**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scheduling Intervals** | You can set the interval for how often the indexer should run. The smallest interval allowed is 5 minutes, and the longest is 24 hours. This is defined using an ISO 8601 duration format, such as `PT15M` for every 15 minutes or `PT2H` for every two hours. |
| **Start Time**      | You can specify a start time for the scheduler in UTC. If omitted, the current time is used. This allows you to control when the first execution occurs.                                                                 |
| **Use Cases**       | Schedulers are beneficial in scenarios where: <ul><li>Source data is frequently updated, and you want the indexer to process these changes automatically.</li><li>The dataset is very large, requiring a recurring schedule to index all content gradually.</li><li>Multiple sources are used to populate an index, and you need to stagger the indexing jobs to avoid conflicts.</li></ul> |
| **Configuration**   | You can configure schedules through the Azure portal, REST APIs, or Azure SDKs. In the portal, you can set the schedule by navigating to the indexer's settings and choosing the desired interval and start time. |
| **Behavior**        | Once an indexer is scheduled, it will continue to run at the specified intervals until the schedule is cleared or the indexer is disabled. If an indexer is still running when the next scheduled execution time arrives, the pending execution is postponed until the current job finishes. |

## Zero Trust 

> Zero Trust AI architecture in Microsoft Azure is a `security framework designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure by assuming that threats can come from both inside and outside the network`. This model operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify", meaning `every access request is thoroughly authenticated and authorized based on all available data points, regardless of its origin. The architecture integrates multiple layers of security, including strong identity verification, device compliance checks, and least privilege access, ensuring that only authorized users and devices can access sensitive resources`. By continuously monitoring and validating each request, Zero Trust AI architecture helps organizations minimize risks and enhance their overall security posture
