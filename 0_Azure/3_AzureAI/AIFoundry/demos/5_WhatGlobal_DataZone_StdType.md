> This guide helps you choose between **Global**, **Standard**, and **Data Zone** deployment types for Azure OpenAI models when all three are available.

## Overview

When deciding between deployment types, consider:
- Data Residency
- Performance
- Compliance
- Cost

## Global
- **Description**: Routes traffic to the best-performing Azure region globally.
- **Key Features**:
  - Best performance and lowest latency.
  - Highest availability.
  - No guarantee of data residency.
- **Best For**:
  - Global apps where performance is critical.
  - Use cases without strict compliance needs.

## Standard
- **Description**: Keeps traffic within a specific Azure region.
- **Key Features**:
  - Ensures regional data residency.
  - Predictable cost and simpler setup.
  - Moderate performance.
- **Best For**:
  - Development, testing, or low-volume production.
  - Apps with regional compliance requirements.

## Data Zone
- **Description**: Regional deployment with enhanced performance via zonal load balancing.
- **Key Features**:
  - Regional data residency.
  - Higher throughput and lower latency than Standard.
- **Best For**:
  - High-throughput, real-time, or production-grade workloads.
  - Apps needing both compliance and performance.

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria                  | Global         | Standard        | Data Zone       |
|---------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Data Residency            | No guarantee   | Yes              | Yes              |
| Performance               | Best           | Moderate         | High             |
| Compliance                | Not suitable   | Compliant        | Compliant        |
| Use Case Fit              | Global apps, low latency | Dev/test, low-volume prod | High-volume prod, real-time |
| Cost & Simplicity         | Variable       | Lower            | Slightly higher  |


## Conclusion

Choose based on your priorities:
- **Global**: Best for performance, not for compliance.
- **Standard**: Best for compliance and simplicity.
- **Data Zone**: Best for performance and compliance in production.
