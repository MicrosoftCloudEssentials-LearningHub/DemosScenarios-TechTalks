------------------------------------------

> Microsoft Foundry is not just a rebrand, it’s a major evolution. `It shifts from model-centric experimentation to agent-centric enterprise AI,
> with unified governance, observability, and developer tooling.` If you used Classic Foundry, expect a more streamlined portal,
> stronger compliance features, and a deeper focus on agents.

## Classic vs. New Foundry

> - Unified AI Platform: Combines `infrastructure, models, agents, and tools under one management layer`
> - Enterprise Ready: `Built-in monitoring, tracing, evaluations, and compliance features`
> - Agent Centric: Designed around `AI agents and workflows rather than just models`
> - Developer-Friendly: Simplifies `project setup, resource management, and SDK/API usage`

`Classic = LLM sandbox`
`New = Agent platform with enterprise governance`

| Aspect | Foundry (Classic) | Foundry (New) |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Focus** | `LLM deployment & experimentation` → Classic Foundry was designed around large language models. Developers could explore different LLMs, fine‑tune them with custom data, and embed them into applications. It was essentially a sandbox for working with generative AI models, not a full enterprise agent platform. | `Agent-first workflows, governance, observability` → The new Foundry shifts from just hosting LLMs to managing **AI agents** that use LLMs as components. It emphasizes workflows, compliance, monitoring, and enterprise‑scale deployment. Models are still there, but they’re part of a larger agent ecosystem. |
| **Portal Experience** | `Fragmented resource creation` → Users had to separately configure model endpoints, storage, and monitoring. | `Streamlined project creation & unified portal` → One project setup provisions everything needed for agents, models, and observability. |
| **Governance** | `Limited enterprise controls` → Basic access and monitoring, but not deep compliance. | `Full enterprise setup: tracing, monitoring, evaluations` → Governance is built in, with dashboards for performance, compliance, and policy enforcement. |
| **Integration** | `Separate tools for models, apps, infra` → Developers had to stitch together SDKs and services. | `Unified under one platform (agents + models + tools)` → A cohesive environment where agents, models, and data connectors work seamlessly. |
| **Evolution** | `Azure AI Foundry branding` → Focused on LLM experimentation within Azure. | `Microsoft Foundry rebrand (Ignite 2025)` → Signals the strategic pivot to enterprise AI agents and unified workflows. |
