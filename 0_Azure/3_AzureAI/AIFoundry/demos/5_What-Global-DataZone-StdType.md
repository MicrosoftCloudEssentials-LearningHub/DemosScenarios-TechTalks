> This overview guide helps you choose between **Global**, **Standard**, and **Data Zone** deployment types for Azure OpenAI models when all three are available. Understanding these deployment options is crucial for optimizing performance, ensuring compliance, and managing costs effectively in your Azure AI implementations.

> [!NOTE]
> - `Regions` refer to `specific Azure datacenter locations`, e.g Sweden Central. `Deployments for stricter compliance needs.`
> - `Data zones` are `logical groupings of these regions that share compliance and data residency characteristics`. E.g, the EU Data Zone includes regions like Sweden Central, West Europe, etc. `Deployments for less region compliance needs.`

> [!TIP]
> The appropriate deployment model depends on your data residency and compliance requirements. Here's a breakdown of the three main options, and we also need to consider the different ways the models are available to be deployed:
> - `Regional PTU`: Use this model when you have strict regional data residency requirements. For example, if you deploy in Sweden Central, all data (`both at rest and in transit`) remains within that `region’s boundaries.`
> - `Standard Deployment`: Choose this when you need to keep data at rest within a specific Azure region, but are comfortable with some flexibility for data in transit.
>   - You select the region (e.g., Sweden Central).
>   - Azure ensures `data at rest stays in that region.`
>   - Data in `transit may leave the region but will remain within the same data zone (e.g., EU).`
> - `Data Zone Deployment`: This model is suitable when you need to ensure that `both data at rest and in transit remain within a specific data zone` (e.g., EU), but you don’t require control over the specific region.
>    - You select the `zone, not the region.`
>    - Azure manages the region placement internally, ensuring all data remains within the selected zone.

## Overview

> When you're deciding between deployment types, there are several important factors you should consider:
- **Data Residency & Compliance Requirements**: Understanding where your data needs to be stored and processed
- **Performance & Latency Needs**: Determining how quickly your application must respond to users
- **Scalability Requirements**: Planning for expected traffic volume and future growth
- **Cost Optimization**: Working within budget constraints while maintaining predictable costs
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting industry-specific regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and others
- **Network Architecture**: Ensuring smooth integration with your existing infrastructure

| Criteria | Global | Standard | Data Zone |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Data Residency** | `No guarantee` - Your data may be processed in any Azure region worldwide based on current load and performance optimization. This makes it unsuitable for organizations with strict data sovereignty requirements or regulatory compliance needs. | `Yes (Regional)` - Data is guaranteed to stay within your selected Azure region throughout the entire processing lifecycle. This ensures compliance with regional regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or local data protection laws that require data to remain within specific geographical boundaries. | `Yes (Regional)` - Data remains within the specified region with enhanced monitoring and additional controls. Provides the same regional guarantees as Standard but with enterprise-grade audit trails and enhanced security measures for sensitive workloads. |
| **Performance** | `Best` - Delivers optimal global performance by intelligently routing requests to the best-performing Azure region based on real-time conditions including latency, load, and availability. Uses dynamic load balancing across multiple regions for maximum efficiency. | `Moderate` - Provides consistent and predictable performance within the selected region. While reliable, it cannot leverage global optimization techniques and is limited by the infrastructure capacity and network conditions of the single chosen region. | `High` - Offers enhanced regional performance through optimized infrastructure, dedicated resources, and zonal load balancing. Significantly better than Standard while maintaining regional boundaries, using advanced routing and resource allocation within the region. |
| **Compliance** | `Not suitable` - Cannot guarantee data residency, making it incompatible with most regulatory frameworks that require data to remain within specific regions. Not recommended for industries with strict compliance requirements like healthcare, finance, or government sectors. | `Compliant` - Fully meets regional compliance requirements including GDPR for European data, HIPAA for healthcare information, and various national data protection regulations. Provides necessary data residency guarantees for most compliance frameworks. | `Compliant` - Meets all regional compliance requirements with additional enterprise features like enhanced audit logging, detailed monitoring, and advanced security controls. Ideal for organizations with strict compliance needs requiring both data residency and premium security features. |
| **Cost** | `Variable` - Pricing fluctuates based on which regions are used, traffic patterns, and current demand across different Azure regions. While potentially cost-efficient for large-scale applications, costs can be unpredictable and may vary significantly month to month. | `Lower` - Most cost-effective option with predictable, fixed regional pricing. No cross-region data transfer charges or variable routing costs. Ideal for budget-conscious deployments where cost predictability is important for financial planning. | `Moderate` - Premium pricing model that reflects the enhanced infrastructure, dedicated resources, and advanced features. Higher cost than Standard but provides significant value through improved performance, reliability, and enterprise-grade capabilities. |
| **Setup Complexity** | `Simple` - Requires minimal configuration as Azure automatically handles all routing decisions and optimization. Users only need to deploy their application without worrying about regional selection or traffic management. Perfect for teams wanting to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management. | `Simple` - Straightforward deployment process with basic regional selection. Easy to configure and manage with standard Azure portal tools. Minimal learning curve and suitable for teams with basic Azure knowledge. No complex routing or load balancing configuration required. | `Moderate` - Requires more sophisticated configuration to take full advantage of zonal load balancing, enhanced monitoring, and advanced features. Teams need to understand availability zones, configure proper monitoring, and optimize resource allocation for best results. |
| **Availability** | `Highest` - Provides maximum availability through multi-region redundancy and automatic failover capabilities. If one region experiences issues, traffic is automatically routed to healthy regions, ensuring minimal downtime and maximum service continuity. | `Regional` - Availability is limited to the capacity and health of the selected region. Vulnerable to regional outages, natural disasters, or large-scale infrastructure issues that could affect the entire region. No automatic failover to other regions. | `Enhanced` - Offers better availability than Standard through zone-level redundancy within the region. Uses multiple availability zones to provide protection against localized failures while maintaining regional data residency requirements. |
| **Latency** | `Lowest` - Achieves minimal latency by routing requests to the geographically closest or best-performing region. Uses real-time performance metrics to ensure users always connect to the optimal endpoint, resulting in the fastest possible response times globally. | `Regional` - Latency is consistent within the region but may not be optimal for all users, especially those located far from the selected region. Performance is predictable but constrained by the single region's geographic location and network infrastructure. | `Low` - Provides better latency than Standard through optimized infrastructure, enhanced networking, and intelligent routing within the region. Uses advanced techniques like zonal distribution and dedicated resources to minimize response times while staying within regional boundaries. |
| **Scalability** | `Global` - Offers unlimited scaling potential across Azure's entire global infrastructure. Can handle massive traffic spikes by distributing load across multiple regions and leveraging the full capacity of Azure's worldwide data centers. | `Regional` - Scaling is constrained by the capacity limits and resource availability of the selected region. May encounter bottlenecks during high demand periods or when regional resources become limited. Scaling potential is finite and dependent on regional infrastructure. | `Enhanced` - Provides significantly better scaling capabilities than Standard through dedicated resources, optimized infrastructure, and advanced resource management within the region. Can handle high-volume production workloads more effectively than Standard deployments. |
| **Use Case Fit** | `Global apps` - Perfect for consumer-facing applications with worldwide users, real-time gaming platforms, global content delivery, and applications where performance is the top priority and compliance requirements are minimal or non-existent. | `Dev/test/low-vol` - Ideal for development environments, testing scenarios, proof-of-concept projects, small to medium applications with regional user bases, and production workloads with moderate traffic that require compliance with regional regulations. | `High-vol prod` - Excellent for mission-critical production workloads, high-throughput applications requiring both compliance and performance, enterprise applications with strict availability requirements, and systems that need regional compliance with premium performance characteristics. |

> [!TIP]
> How to Choose the Right Deployment Type? Think about these three main questions:
> 
> **1. Where must your data stay?**
> - If your data MUST stay in one country/region (for laws like GDPR) → Choose **Standard** or **Data Zone**
> - If your data can go anywhere → Choose **Global**
>   
> **2. How important is speed?**
> - If you want the fastest speed possible → Choose **Global**
> - If you want good speed but data must stay in one region → Choose **Data Zone**
> - If normal speed is okay → Choose **Standard**
>   
> **3. How much can you spend?**
> - If you want to spend less money → Choose **Standard**
> - If you can spend more for better features → Choose **Data Zone**
> - If cost can change and that's okay → Choose **Global**
> 
> **Quick Decision Helper:**
> - **Global** = Best speed everywhere, but data moves between countries
> - **Standard** = Data stays in one place, normal speed, costs less
> - **Data Zone** = Data stays in one place, better speed, costs more
> 
> **Most common choices:**
> - Testing new apps → **Standard**
> - Apps for people around the world → **Global**
> - Important business apps that must follow local laws → **Data Zone**
