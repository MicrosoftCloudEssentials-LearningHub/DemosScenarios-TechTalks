> Truncation often results from exceeding token limits or poor chunking strategies. Complex documents (those with conditional logic, sparse entities, or nested structures) can tokenize inefficiently.

## Overview 

> Why Truncation Happens (Even in Shorter, Complex Documents)? <br/>
> `Truncation happens when the total token count for your prompt and its output goes over the model’s limit. But here’s the catch: it’s not just about how long your prompt is, how complex it is can also bump up the token usage.`

| Cause                        | Description                                                                                   | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Complexity        | Conditional logic, nested clauses, or sparse named entities lead to inefficient tokenization | Increases token count unexpectedly, risking mid-sentence truncation             |
| Tokenizer Behavior           | Azure OpenAI uses subword tokenization (e.g., `tiktoken`)                                     | Complex or rare words may consume more tokens than expected                     |
| Verbose or Tangential Output| High temperature settings cause longer, less focused completions                             | May exceed token limits and truncate output mid-thought                         |

<summary><b> Structural Complexity </b> (Click to expand)</summary>
  
> Documents with **conditional logic**, **nested clauses**, or **sparse named entities** are structurally complex. These patterns confuse tokenizers because they lack clear semantic anchors (like names or dates) and often involve long, interdependent clauses.

> E.g: `If the system fails to initialize, and the fallback protocol is not triggered unless the override is active, then the watchdog timer must be reset manually.`
> This sentence, while not long, contains multiple conditions and dependencies. Tokenizers break it into many subword units, inflating the token count.

> Why It Matter?

- You may hit token limits even with seemingly short documents.
- Truncation may occur mid-sentence or mid-logic, leading to incomplete or incoherent outputs.

> How to Address?

- Use **semantic chunking** to isolate logical units (e.g., one condition per chunk).
- Preprocess documents to simplify or flatten nested logic where possible.

<summary><b> Tokenizer Behavior </b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Azure OpenAI uses the same tokenizer as OpenAI, typically `tiktoken`. This tokenizer breaks text into **subword tokens**, not full words. For example:
> - “Initialization” → `["Initial", "ization"]`  
> - “FallbackProtocol” → `["Fallback", "Protocol"]`

> Complex syntax, rare words, or compound identifiers (like in code or legal text) often result in more tokens per word than expected.

> **Why It Matters**

- Token count can balloon unexpectedly, even in short or medium-length documents.  
- This can lead to premature truncation or rejection of prompts that exceed model limits.

> **How to Address**

- Use the `tiktoken` library to **pre-calculate token usage** before sending prompts.  
- Normalize or simplify text during preprocessing (e.g., split compound words).  
- Avoid overly technical phrasing unless necessary.

<summary><b> Verbose or Tangential Output </b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> The `temperature` parameter controls randomness in model output:
> - **High temperature (0.8–1.0)** → creative, verbose, tangential  
> - **Low temperature (0.2–0.4)** → focused, deterministic, concise

> High temperature can cause the model to “ramble”, using more tokens than necessary and increasing the risk of hitting token limits.

> **Why It Matters**

- Verbose completions may exceed token budgets, especially in stateless or high-throughput scenarios.  
- Truncation may occur mid-sentence or mid-thought, degrading output quality.

> **How to Address**

- For structured tasks (e.g., summarization, extraction), set:
  ```json
  {
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "top_p": 0.9
  }
  ```
- Use `max_tokens` to cap output length.  
- Define `stop` sequences to cut off output at logical boundaries (e.g., `["\n\n", "###"]`).
