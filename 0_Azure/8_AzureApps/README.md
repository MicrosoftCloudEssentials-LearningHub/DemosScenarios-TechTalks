| **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** | Managed Kubernetes for containerized workloads. Ideal for microservices and cloud-native architectures. |
| **Azure Functions** | Serverless compute to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure. Pay only for execution time. |
| **Azure Container Apps** | Serverless containers for microservices and APIs, with built-in scaling and Dapr integration. |
| **Logic Apps** | Low-code/no-code workflows to automate business processes and integrate with hundreds of connectors. |
| **API Management** | Publish, secure, and monitor APIs for internal and external consumers. |
| **Azure Spring Apps** | Managed Spring Boot service for Java developers. |
| **App Configuration & Feature Management** | Centralized configuration and feature flags for modern apps. |

## Modernization Scenarios

| Scenario | How Azure Helps |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Lift & Shift** | Migrate existing apps to Azure VMs or App Service with minimal changes. |
| **Refactor** | Containerize apps and deploy to AKS or Container Apps for better scalability and DevOps. |
| **Rearchitect** | Break monoliths into microservices using AKS, Functions, and Event Grid. |
| **Rebuild** | Build cloud-native apps from scratch using serverless and PaaS offerings. |
