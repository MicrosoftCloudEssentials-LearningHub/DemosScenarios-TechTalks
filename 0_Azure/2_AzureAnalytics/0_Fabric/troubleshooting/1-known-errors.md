Let's say you want only `viewer` permissions:

1. Need to give access to the lakehouse/sql analytics endpoint:

    > `Read All SQL Endpoint Data` permission allows users to access and read data from SQL endpoints within the Fabric environment. This permission is typically required for users who need to: <br/>
    > - Query Data: Execute SQL `queries against the data stored in the Fabric environment`. <br/>
    > - Access Reports: `View and interact with reports and dashboards that rely on SQL data sources`. <br/>
    > - Data Analysis: `Perform data analysis and generate insights` using SQL-based data.

2. Make sure the person already have access to the semantic model:

> - Granting `Read, ReadData` access to the `semantic model, sql analytics endpoint` <br/>
> - Grating `App audience` will enable the assigned identity to view it.

## Upgrade your Power BI license

```
To use Power BI Premium Per User features, upgrade your license.
```

</p>

> [!TIP]
> This means that the workspace is supported by a `Premium per-user` license. You are attempting to access content with either a `Pro` user license or a `Free` user license. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to either purchase the necessary PPU license for the user or support the workspace with an F64 capacity, allowing free users to view the content. If editing permissions are still needed, those users will require a Pro license.

## Sporadic Access Error in Premium Workspace with Free Users

> User experiencing sporadic access errors when trying to access content in a Premium workspace. The error message indicates that the content is only available to Power BI Pro users, even though the workspace is hosted on Premium capacity.

> [!TIP]
> - `Licensing Confusion`: Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium are different licenses. Pro is for individual users, while Premium is for capacity. `Free users can view reports in a Premium workspace, but they cannot manage or edit content without a Pro license`. <br/>
> - `User Permissions`: If a user is an admin, member, or contributor in a workspace, `they need a Pro license to edit or modify reports, even in a Premium workspace`. <br/>
> - `Intermittent Connectivity Issues`: Network issues or temporary connectivity problems can cause licensing checks to fail, resulting in access errors. <br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If all previous tips do not work, please consider the following steps

1. `Create a New Capacity in Microsoft Fabric`:
   - Go to the [Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) and select the gear icon (âš™) to open the Admin portal.
