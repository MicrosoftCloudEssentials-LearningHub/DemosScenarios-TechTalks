----------

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each standard trial of a Microsoft Fabric capacity includes `64 capacity units`. `The person who initiates the trial becomes the Capacity administrator for that trial capacity`. Other users within the same tenant can also start their own Fabric trial and become Capacity administrators for their respective trial capacities. However, `there is a limit on the number of trial capacities that can be created per tenant`. If your tenant has reached this limit, you need to purchase a Fabric capacity, consider reservations for discounts.

## Roles in Workspaces in Microsoft Fabric

|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Member      | Add/remove people, create/modify content, share items                       |
| Contributor | Create/modify content, limited sharing capabilities                         |
| Viewer      | View/read content, no modification capabilities                             |

## How to extend trial period 

> [!NOTE]
> - If you are an existing customer, please create a support request to ask for an extension so your assigned team can collaborate with the support team to extend your trial period. Provide your trial capacity ID and explain the reason for the extension. You can find your trial capacity ID in the Account Manager under Trial status. <br/> 
> - If you a `new customer`, Contact the [Microsoft Sales Team](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/#contact-sales) so they can engage with you and provide the best service. <br/>
