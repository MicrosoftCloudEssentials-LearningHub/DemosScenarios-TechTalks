----------

> The goal is to collect endpoint telemetry logs, such as registry changes, port activity, filesystem modifications, process information, and service details, into Splunk. This data will be used for incident response, threat hunting, and compliance. <br/>

> [Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting Add-on for Splunk](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5518) can pull the necessary data. This add-on provides field extractions and CIM (Common Information Model: it is a standard used in Splunk to normalize data from different sources into a common format) compatibility for the Endpoint datamodel for Microsoft Defender Advanced Hunting data. It maps Device Alert events to the Alerts datamodel and supports detection searches in Splunk Enterprise Security Content Update.

### Step 1: Determine Ingress Data Rate

| **Step**          | **Action**| **Example**| **Metric**        | **Value**             | **Formula** |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Data Sources**  | Identify all devices and systems that will provide telemetry data.| Endpoints, servers, network devices, applications.| **Number of Sources** | Endpoints: 200, Servers: 50 | N/A|
| **Data Volume**   | Calculate the average amount of data generated by each source per second.| Endpoint generates 0.25 MB/s, server generates 1 MB/s.| **Total Data Volume (MB/s)** | Endpoints: 50, Servers: 50 | Number of Sources * Data Volume per Source |
| **Event Rate**    | Determine the frequency of events generated by each source per second.| Endpoint generates 2 events/s, server generates 5 events/s.| **Total Event Rate (events/s)** | Endpoints: 400, Servers: 250 | Number of Sources * Event Rate per Source |

### Step 2: Calculate Throughput Units (TUs)

> Each TU provides: <br/>
> Up to 1 MB per second of ingress events. <br/>
> Up to 2 MB per second of egress events.

> [!NOTE]
> The required TUs will be the maximum of the two calculated values.

$$
\text{Required TUs} = \max \left( \frac{\text{Ingress MB/s}}{1}, \frac{\text{Events/second}}{1000} \right)
$$

### Step 3: Monitor and Adjust

1. **Deploy the Event Hub** with the calculated TUs.
2. **Monitor Metrics** to ensure the Event Hub performs as expected.
3. **Adjust TUs** as needed based on real-time data.
4. **Auto-Inflate Feature**: Start with a lower number of TUs and set an upper threshold for automatic scaling.

## Example Calculation

> Assume we have 200 endpoints and 50 servers. <br/>
> - Each endpoint sends 0.25 MB of data per second and generates 2 events per second.
> - Each server sends 1 MB of data per second and generates 5 events per second.

1. **Total Ingress Data Rate**:

$$
\text{Total Ingress MB/s} = (\text{Number of Endpoints} \times \text{Data Volume per Endpoint (MB/s)}) + (\text{Number of Servers} \times \text{Data Volume per Server (MB/s)})
$$

$$
\text{Total Ingress MB/s} = (200 \text{ endpoints} \times 0.25 \text{ MB/s per endpoint}) + (50 \text{ servers} \times 1 \text{ MB/s per server}) = 50 \text{ MB/s} + 50 \text{ MB/s} = 100 \text{ MB/s}
$$

2. **Total Event Rate**:

$$
\text{Total Events/second} = (\text{Number of Endpoints} \times \text{Event Rate per Endpoint (events/second)}) + (\text{Number of Servers} \times \text{Event Rate per Server (events/second)})
$$

$$
\text{Total Events/second} = (200 \text{ endpoints} \times 2 \text{ events/second per endpoint}) + (50 \text{ servers} \times 5 \text{ events/second per server}) = 400 \text{ events/second} + 250 \text{ events/second} = 650 \text{ events/second}
$$

3. **Calculate Required TUs**:

> Required TUs for MB/s (Ingress Data):

$$
\text{Required TUs for MB/s} = \frac{\text{Total Ingress MB/s}}{1 \text{ MB/s per TU}}
$$

$$
\text{Required TUs for MB/s} = \frac{100 \text{ MB/s}}{1 \text{ MB/s per TU}} = 100 \text{ TUs}
$$

> Required TUs for Events/second:

$$
\text{Required TUs for Events/second} = \frac{\text{Total Events/second}}{1000 \text{ events/second per TU}}
$$

$$
\text{Required TUs for Events/second} = \frac{650 \text{ events/second}}{1000 \text{ events/second per TU}} = 0.65 \text{ TUs}
$$

4. **Determine the Maximum Value**:

$$
\text{Required TUs} = \max \left( \frac{\text{Total Ingress MB/s}}{1}, \frac{\text{Total Events/second}}{1000} \right)
$$

$$
\text{Required TUs} = \max(100, 0.65) = 100 \text{ TUs}
$$

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Data Sources**  | Identify all devices and systems that will provide telemetry data.                            | Endpoints, servers, network devices, applications.                          | **Number of Sources** | Endpoints: 200, Servers: 50 | N/A         |
| **Data Volume**   | Calculate the average amount of data generated by each source per second.                     | Endpoint generates 0.25 MB/s, server generates 1 MB/s.                      | **Total Data Volume (MB/s)** | Endpoints: 50, Servers: 50 | Number of Sources * Data Volume per Source |
| **Event Rate**    | Determine the frequency of events generated by each source per second.                        | Endpoint generates 2 events/s, server generates 5 events/s.                 | **Total Event Rate (events/s)** | Endpoints: 400, Servers: 250 | Number of Sources * Event Rate per Source |
| **Required TUs**  | Calculate the required Throughput Units based on data volume and event rate.                  | Total Ingress MB/s = 100, Total Events/second = 650                          | **Required TUs** | 100 | Max value between the two: 100/1 = (100) or 650/1000 = (0.65) |

## How to achieve more TUs

> Azure Event Hubs has specific limits on the number of Throughput Units (TUs) that can be assigned to a single Event Hub. As of my last update, the maximum number of TUs for a single Event Hub in the Standard tier is 40. If you need more than 40 TUs, you would need to use multiple Event Hubs or consider other strategies.

| **Method**| **Description**| **Steps** |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Using Multiple Event Hubs with Load Balancer** | Distribute the data load across multiple Event Hubs using a load balancer.| Create four Event Hubs with 25 TUs each, set up load balancer, configure data sources.|
| **Partitioning Data Streams**           | Divide data streams into smaller chunks and send to different Event Hubs.| Create multiple Event Hubs, partition data streams, configure data sources.|
| **Using Event Hub Namespaces**          | Manage multiple Event Hubs under a single namespace.| Create an Event Hub namespace, create multiple Event Hubs, configure data sources.            |
| **Using Azure Stream Analytics**        | Process and route data streams to multiple Event Hubs.| Create Stream Analytics job, configure inputs and outputs, define query.                      |
| **Using Azure Data Factory**            | Orchestrate and manage data flows between multiple Event Hubs.| Create Data Factory, create pipelines, configure data sources, configure Event Hubs.          |
| **Using Event Hubs Dedicated Clusters** | Provision a single-tenant cluster with high capacity and low latency.| Create a dedicated cluster, create namespaces and event hubs, distribute data.                |
