----------

> [!NOTE]
> Why You Might Not See `LLM` Yet? <br/> 
> - Your environment might not be part of the early release cycle.
> - It may just be a matter of timing.
> - Your tenant or admin settings might need to enable LLM manually once it's generally available.


> [!TIP]
> What You Can Do?
> - Check with your tenant admin to see if your environment is part of the early release cycle.
> - Look for updates in the Model selection dropdown in the agent settings, LLM should appear soon.
> - Keep an eye on the Copilot Studio blog or release notes for rollout updates.
