| Purpose | Microsoft Planner is a task management tool designed for team collaboration. It allows users to create plans, assign tasks, share files, and organize work in a visual way. |
| User Interface | Microsoft Planner has a user-friendly interface that allows users to create a plan, assign tasks, and share files with others. It also provides real-time updates and built-in analytics to evaluate progress. However, it doesn't support creating surveys or quizzes, for that you can use Microsoft Forms. |

| Security | Microsoft Planner is part of the Microsoft 365 suite, which has robust security measures in place. While it's true that Microsoft has algorithms to detect and block phishing attempts, it's important to note that these security measures apply to the entire Microsoft 365 suite, not just Planner. |
| Integration | Microsoft Planner is integrated with other Microsoft 365 apps, which means tasks and plans can be accessed across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. |
| Pricing | Microsoft Planner is included in Microsoft 365 subscriptions. There are also standalone plans available for purchase. |
